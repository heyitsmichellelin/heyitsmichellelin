# Hey, it's Michelle Lin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year software engineering major at UC Irvine and I love connecting with different disciplines through computer science. As of now, I'm learning Python and working at a club at UCI called Commit the Change. This is just the start of my CS journey and I can't wait to explore along the way! Come follow me on my journey by connecting with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellelinca/) or shoot me an email at <itsmichellelin@gmail.com>!

### About Me âœ¨
- other than CS, I'm also interested in psychology, sociology, healthcare, and minimalist art
- my long term career goal is to help create AI-powered devices that can detect diseases earlier
- I'm most knowledgable in Python, but I'm also learning some HTML and CSS

### Current Courses ðŸ“š
