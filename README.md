# Hey, it's Michelle Lin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate from University of California, Irvine with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering and I love connecting different disciplines through computer science. I served as President at a UCI campus organization called [Commit the Change](https://ctc-uci.com/) from 2023-24, where I was previously a full-stack developer and Membership Director. This is just the start of my CS journey and I can't wait to explore along the way! Come follow me on my journey by connecting with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellelinca/) or shoot me an email at <itsmichellelin@gmail.com>!

## About Me âœ¨
- other than CS, I'm also interested in psychology, sociology, and fashion
- my long term career goal is to become a subject matter expert in a niche I love after I explore different industries
- I'm experienced in Python, JavaScript, Java, HTML, CSS, C++, React, Flutter, Angular, SQL, and Bash



  
*Ask me about the intersection between sociology and AI ethics!*
