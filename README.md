# Hey, it's Michelle Lin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineering major at UC Irvine and I love connecting different disciplines through computer science. I served as President at a UCI campus organization called [Commit the Change](https://ctc-uci.com/) from 2023-24, where I was previously a full-stack developer and Membership Director.
